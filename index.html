<p> <img src="https://github.com/ionagael/CNIT133/blob/main/images/phil.PNG?raw=true" alt="phil" style="float:right;width:42px;height:42px;">My name is Philip Burkart. I lived in China for 6 years. While in China, I completed a degree in teaching Mandarin. After that, I moved back to America and joined the National Guard. I eventually became a Green Beret, which was my life for 5 years. I currently work in software sales. I own 5 properties, one of which I am converting into a small coffeeshop.</p>
<p>I'm attending this class for a couple reasons. I like to build things, and I think this class will better teach me how to build with HTML, CSS, and Java for phones. Second, I'm trying to create a back-up skill for myself in case I ever want to change careers.</p>
